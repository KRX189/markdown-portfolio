I'm a **student**, I try to learn something _valuable_ from everywhere
I believe in the **concept of problem solving** and what it _**means**_ to be an **Engineer**
I do try to find _abstract knowledge_ about the things I learn and to learn and implement them **creatively**
_ **Imagination** is the key to **understanding** the universe_
